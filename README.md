I am a project manager and analyst interested in sustainability and renewable energy who is building expertise in software development, data wrangling and data analysis.

Since I discovered Python in the context of web scraping and data analysis I canâ€™t stop learning about open source tools and putting them to use.

Public repositories here document part of my journey of learning to program.
